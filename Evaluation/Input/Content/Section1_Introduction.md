MEDI-524 is a humanized monoclonal antibody (IgG1) against the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) ([Dall’Acqua2006](#5-references)).

MEDI-524 shows a pharmacokinetic behavior which is typical for an antibody without endogenous target. The plasma concentration–time profile after intravenous application of a 30 mg/kg dose in cynomolgus monkeys ([Dall’Acqua2006](#5-references)) were used together with pharmacokinetic (PK) data from 5 other compounds to identify unknown parameters during the development of the generic large molecule physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model in PK-Sim ([Niederalt 2018](#5-references)). 

The herein presented evaluation report evaluates the performance of the PBPK model for MEDI-524 in cynomolgus monkeys for the PK data used for the development of the generic large molecule model in PK-Sim.

The presented MEDI-524 PBPK model as well as the respective evaluation plan and evaluation report are provided open-source (https://github.com/Open-Systems-Pharmacology/MEDI524-Model).
